# Hex City Planner - Development Notes

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### City Layout System
1. Hex Grid Structure
   - Center tile (ring 0) + 3 rings (6, 12, 18 tiles)
   - Position system uses (ring, index) coordinates
   - Clockwise indexing from top
   - Rationale: Simple to understand and maintain, efficient for adjacency calculations

2. Adjacency Patterns
   ```
   Center (ring 0): 
   - Adjacent to all 6 tiles in ring 1
   
   Ring 1:
   - Adjacent to center
   - Adjacent to 2 other Ring 1 tiles
   - Adjacent to 3 Ring 2 tiles
   
   Ring 2:
   - Adjacent to 1 Ring 1 tile
   - Adjacent to 2 other Ring 2 tiles
   - Adjacent to 3 Ring 3 tiles
   
   Ring 3:
   - Adjacent to 1 Ring 2 tile
   - Adjacent to 2 other Ring 3 tiles
   ```

3. Building Placement Rules
   - Maximum 2 buildings per tile
   - Buildings must be compatible to form quarters
   - Must meet terrain and feature requirements
   - Fresh water requirements checked

### Data Structure Design
1. Terrain System
   - Base terrain types
   - Variations (Flat, Rough, Mountainous)
   - Features as separate layer
   - Fresh water as tile property

2. Building System
   - Base yields
   - Placement requirements
   - Adjacency bonuses
   - Quarter formation rules

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests
   - Grid initialization
   - Terrain management
   - Building placement
   - Adjacency calculations
   - Validation rules

2. Planned Tests
   - Yield calculations
   - Optimization results
   - Complex placement scenarios

## Known Issues & Workarounds
1. None currently documented

## Future Considerations
1. Performance Optimization
   - Consider caching adjacency calculations
   - Optimize yield calculations for frequent updates

2. Extensibility
   - Keep data structures flexible for new features
   - Plan for policy system integration
   - Consider mod support

## Development Guidelines
1. Code Organization
   - Core logic in backend/
   - Data definitions in rules/
   - Tests mirror source structure

2. Testing Requirements
   - All core functionality must have tests
   - Adjacency patterns need thorough validation
   - Building placement rules need comprehensive coverage

3. Documentation Standards
   - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md for major changes
   - Document technical decisions here
   - Include rationale for significant changes
